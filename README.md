VCV Rack modules

A collection of modules for [VCV Rack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack), a cross platform opensource, modular synth emulator software.

Modules are polyphonic where applicable. Early releases and beta modules can be found here on github, before being submitted to the VCV libary.

## Building from code

Instructions can be found in the VCV manual https://vcvrack.com/manual/Building#building-rack-plugins

 ### Wallenda
 
  <img align="left" src="images/Wallenda.png">

 A delay plugin designed for use when using [Karplusâ€“Strong string synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karplus%E2%80%93Strong_string_synthesis) featuring:
 
 - Delay time tuned to pitch, via the V/oct input and the two tune knobs, Octave selector and fine tune in semitones
 - Feedback control, focusing on the area required for the string delay
 - Seven voice unison per polyphonic channel
 - Stretch, the nature of strings gives a natural decay, this controls the length
 - Polyphonic, the number of channels is defined by the audio input
 
 The main audio input should be triggered with noise, the color and duration of this has a large impact on the resulting sound. Try experimenting with short bursts, such as snare sounds, longer noise sounds with automated frequency can be used to emulate a bowed sound. All varations of sound input can be used to create sounds.

### Maccomo  

 <img align="left" src="images/Maccomo.png">

An emulation of a ladder filter, based on the descriptions and block diagrams in Will Pirkles book "Designing Software Synthesizers Plugins in C++" featuring:

- Six modes, selectable via CV and the knob, allowing for automatiom between lp12, lp24, hp12, hp24, bp12 and bp24
- Frequency contols are summed, for accurate pitch tracking set the knob to C4 261Hz and use the V/oct input
- Resonance that allows for self oscillation
- Drive to add colour and dirt to the sound, works well when self oscillating
- Polyphonic, the number of channels is defined by the audio input or the V/oct input for use as an oscillator

If the audio input is disconnected, the filter will still run in monophonic mode or with the channel count of the V/oct input, allowing for self oscillation and use as a VCO.

### Massarti

A feedfoward comb filter with added feeback loop, can be used to create pitched sounds from noise, or for the adding of overtones

- Frequency contols are summed, for accurate pitch tracking
- Comb control adjusts the magnitude of the harmonic bands, positive values boost, negative values cut
- Feedback adds warmth, and reverb like effect
- Polyphonic, the number of channels is defined by the audio input

### Tyrant

<img align="left" src="images/Tyrant.png">


A monophonic in, polyphonic out shift register, with many probability options.

- Variable number of polyphonic channels for 1 - 16
- Trigger Probability controls the chance of triggers being skipped
- Shuffle Probability controls the values in the buffer being reordered
- Three accent controls
- Accent A & B apply a fixed offset, Accent RNG applies a random offset with the maximum value defined by the offset controls
- If any of the probability CV's have no input or a monophonic input all channels are affected simultaneously, If the probability cv inputs have polyphonic inputs the channels are effected independently
- The Reset input sets the current channel count to 1 and samples the input, the channel count is increased on each trigger input, until the desired channel count is reached

A cascadable two way crossover, used for splitting audio frequency bands, for multiband processing

- Polyphonic
- Frequency controls the band ranges
- Summed output has a flat frequency response
- Can be cascaded for any number of bands
